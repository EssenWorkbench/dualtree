# dualtree
Python package, based on PyWavelets, implementing Nick Kingsbury's dual-tree complex wavelet transform.

The purpose of implementing the dual-tree complex wavelet transform was for it's use in baseline-removal of digital signals. This package is provided as part of the research published in the following article:

- L. P. Ren√© de Cotret and B. J. Siwick, <i>A general method for baseline-removal in ultrafast electron powder diffraction data using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform</i>, Struct. Dyn. 4 (2017) DOI: 10.1063/1.4972518.

*This package has been integrated in [scikit-ued](https://www.github.com/LaurentRDC/scikit-ued).*

## Contents

From the package docstrings:

### dualtree, idualtree
Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (and its inverse) implemented using PyWavelets. Implementation
tricks from [1], such as first stage filtering and filter swapping at later stages, are also
included.

### approx_rec, detail_rec
Decomposition and recomposition of signals using only approximate or detail coefficients.

### dualtree_max_level
Maximal decomposition level of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform.

### baseline
Baseline determination of signals using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform. Modified algorithm
from [2].

### denoiseDenoising of signals using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform.

### dualtree_wavelet
Pair of real and imaginary wavelet that forms a complex wavelet appropriate for the dual-tree
complex wavelet transform.

### dualtree_first_stage
Pair of real and imaginary wavelet, shifted by one sample with respect to one another, forming a complex
wavelet appropriate for first-stage filtering during the dual-tree complex wavelet transform.

## Example

We start with the base:

    >>> from dualtree import dualtre, idualtree, baseline
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Here is an example of getting the dual-tree complex wavelet transform coefficients from real data:

    >>> signal = n.load('~\data\diffraction.npy')                           # Included example electron diffraction data
    >>> coeffs = dualtree(signal, wavelet = 'qshift3', level = 4)
    >>> reconstructed = idualtree(coeffs = coeffs, wavelet = 'qshift3')     # level is inferred
    >>> n.allclose(signal, reconstructed)                                   # Check perfect reconstruction
    True

Example of algorithm (baseline-determination) on a NumPy array:

    >>> signal = n.load('~\data\diffraction.npy')
    >>> background = baseline(signal, wavelet = 'qshift3', max_iter = 100)  # Might not be optimal parameters
    >>> plt.plot(signal, '.k', background, '.r')

## Baseline-removal


## TODO

There are a few things left to do before hitting version 1.0:

1. Implementation beyond 1D: the dualtree and idualtree functions have to be implemented for 2D images.

2. Algorithms: a more robust denoising algorithm should be implemented.
