DUALTREE

Author: Laurent P. Ren√© de Cotret

Python implementation of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform, based on [1].

Functions
---------
dualtree, idualtree
    Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (and its inverse) implemented using PyWavelets. Implementation
    tricks from [1], such as first stage filtering and filter swapping at later stages, are also
    included.

approx_rec, detail_rec
    Decomposition and recomposition of signals using only approximate or detail coefficients.

dualtree_max_level
    Maximal decomposition level of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform.

baseline
    Baseline determination of signals using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform. Modified algorithm
    from [2].

baseline_dwt
    Baseline determination of signals using the discrete wavelet transform. Provided for comparison
    with the dual-tree equivalent 'baseline'. Algorithm described in [2].

denoise
    Denoising of signals using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform.

denoise_dwt
    Denoising of signals using the discrete wavelet transform. Provided for comparison
    with the dual-tree equivalent 'denoise'.

dualtree_wavelet
    Pair of real and imaginary wavelet that forms a complex wavelet appropriate for the dual-tree
    complex wavelet transform.

dualtree_first_stage
    Pair of real and imaginary wavelet, shifted by one sample with respect to one another, forming a complex
    wavelet appropriate for first-stage filtering during the dual-tree complex wavelet transform.
