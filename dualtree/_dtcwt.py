    1D dual-tree complex wavelet transform, implemented from [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: array_like
        Input data. Only 1D arrays are supported for now. 2D support is planned.
    first_stage : str, optional
        Wavelet to use for the first stage. See dualtree.ALL_FIRST_STAGE for a list of suitable arguments
    wavelet : str, optional
        Wavelet to use in stages > 1. Must be appropriate for the dual-tree complex wavelet transform.
        See dualtree.ALL_COMPLEX_WAV for possible
    level : int or 'max', optional
        Decomposition level (must be >= 0). If level is 'max' (default) then it
        will be calculated using the ``dualtree_max_level`` function.
    mode : str, optional
        Signal extension mode, see pywt.Modes.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the transform. Default is -1

    Returns
    -------
    [cA_n, cD_n, cD_n-1, ..., cD2, cD1] : list
        Ordered list of coefficients arrays
        where `n` denotes the level of decomposition. The first element
        (`cA_n`) of the result is approximation coefficients array and the
        following elements (`cD_n` - `cD_1`) are details coefficients arrays.
        Arrays have the same number of dimensions as the input.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if level < 0
    
    Notes
    -----
    The implementation uses two tricks presented in [1]:
        `` Different first-stage wavelet ``
            The first level of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform involves a combo of shifted wavelets.
        
        `` Swapping of filters at each stage ``
            At each level > 1, the filters (separated into real and imaginary trees) are swapped.
